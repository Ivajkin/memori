* Add proper support for KWebKitPart in the following Konqueror kpart plugins:
    - searchbar    support for 'opensearch' only works with KHTML.
    - kget         download selection and other advanced features only work
                   with KHTML and the features that work still use KHTML
                   classes resulting in two rendering engines being active
                   at one time.
    - adblock      again tight integration as available in khtml is completely
                   missing. Bonus: this functionality without modifying any code
                   inside of the kwebkitpart or the kdewebkit components.

* Add support for KPartStatusBarExtension and hence the following features:
      - RSS feed integration.
      - Full ad-block integration (rudimentary blocking already there).
      - Popup blocker integration (completely absent now, might require upstream changes).
      - KWallet integration (only the status icon/user-control portions).

* Implement a means of showing the following information (Perhaps do "about:engine"?):
      - Show kwebkitpart's version number
      - Show qtwebkit's version number
      - Show KDE's version number

* Look through all the Konqueror web configuration options and make sure we honor
  all those that we possibly can. Please note that some of these features will need
  to be implemented upstream in the rendering engine. Here is a list of khtml features
  currently known not to work:
      - Change cursor over links (TODO).
      - Smooth scrolling support (TODO).
      - Underline links support (Partial, does not seem to work).
      - Right click goes back in history (TODO).
      - Allow automatic delayed reloading/redirecting (QtWebKit Bug #29899).
      - Enable access key navigation with Ctrl key (TODO, QtWebKit??).
      - Animations (???).
      - Draw frames around not completely loaded images (???).
