* Add proper support for KWebKitPart in the following Konqueror kpart plugins:
    - kget         need to fix selected link downloads.
    - adblock      none of this plugins advanced features work in kwebkitpart.
                   Though rudimentary ad blocking support is already there, the
                   advanced functions are currently khtml specific and need to
                   be amended to support kwebkitpart.

                   NOTE: unlike KHTML, the advanced features support can be
                   completely implemented outside of the kwebkitpart source tree.

* Add KPartStatusBarExtension support for the following plugins/features:
      - Ad-block (plugin)
      - Popup blocker (non-plugin)

* Implement a means of showing the following information (Perhaps "about:engine"?):
      - Show KWebKitPart's version #
      - Show QtWebKit's version #

* Look through all of Konqueror's web configuration options and make sure we
  honor all those that we possibly can... Here is a list of options that
  currently do not work:
      - Change cursor over links (TODO, QtWebKit support required ???).
      - Smooth scrolling support (TODO).
      - Underline links support (Partial, does not seem to work).
      - Right click goes back in history (TODO).
      - Allow automatic delayed reloading/redirecting (QtWebKit Bug #29899).
      - Enable access key navigation with Ctrl key (TODO, QtWebKit support required??).
      - Animations (TODO, QtWebKit support required???).
      - Draw frames around not completely loaded images (TODO, QtWebKit support required???).
