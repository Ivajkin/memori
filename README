KWebKitPart
===========

KWebKitPart is a web browser component for KDE (KPart). You can use
it for example for browsing the web in Konqueror.

KWebKitPart is still in early development and thus not guaranted to
be in production quality yet.

There are known limitations / issues; please see the following two
documents before reporting issues:
* http://websvn.kde.org/*checkout*/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/kdewebkit/ISSUES
* http://websvn.kde.org/*checkout*/trunk/extragear/base/kwebkitpart/TODO

Please report any issues to: https://bugs.kde.org
IMPORTANT: Do not select "konqueror" as product, but "kwebkitpart"!

KDE 4.4 or greater is required for building and running KWebKitPart.


How to use KWebKitPart in Konqueror
===================================

You can switch between the different rendering engines:
View -> View Mode -> {KHTML, WebKit} (Website needs to be open)
If WebKit does not show up in Konqueror, run 'kbuildsycoca4' and
restart Konqueror.

If you want to set KWebKitPart as default for any website, run:
'keditfiletype text/html'
and move "WebKit (kwebkitpart)" in the "Embedding" tab to the top.
