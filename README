Basic build instructions:

Recent Qt 4.4 snapshot or qt-copy is required for building the QtWebkKit
KPart.

If Konqueror takes KHTML instead of WebKit, run 'kbuildsycoca4' before
starting Konqueror. You can also switch between the different engines:
View -> View Mode -> {KHTML, WebKit} (Website needs to be opened)
